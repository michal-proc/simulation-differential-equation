# Differential Equation

The solution to the differential equation presented in the file *'doc/variatonal_formulation.pdf'* is implemented in R.

In addition to the PDF, the repository contains LaTeX files (located in the `doc/` directory) that describe the formulation and derivation of the equation. You can view or modify the LaTeX files to better understand the details of the equation.

## How to Run the Solution in R

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed:
1. **R**: Download and install R from the official website [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/).
2. **RStudio** (optional but recommended): An IDE for R that simplifies working with R scripts and projects.

### Running the Solution

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd simulation-differential-equation
   ```

2. **Open the R script**:
   Navigate to the `code/` folder, where the R script for solving the differential equation is located.

3. **Run the R script**:
   You can run the script either in RStudio or directly from the command line using:
   ```bash
   Rscript main.R
   ```

4. **View the Results**:
   The script will output results, including plots or tables (depending on the script's implementation). These results will give insights into the behavior and solution of the differential equation.
